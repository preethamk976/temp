Learning Objectives
- Define natural frequency for undamped and damped systems.
- Derive and use formulas for undamped natural frequency (ω_n) and damped natural frequency (ω_d).
- Explain damping ratio (ζ) and classification: underdamped, critically damped, overdamped.
- Apply concepts to common machine components (shafts, bearings, gear trains).
- Show simple calculations and design/diagnostic guidelines.

Vibration Basics (Single DOF mass-spring-damper)
Free vibration equation for a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system:
m x'' + c x' + k x = 0

Where:
- m = mass (kg)
- c = damping coefficient (N·s/m)
- k = stiffness (N/m)
- x = displacement

Undamped System (c = 0)
Equation: m x'' + k x = 0
Solution freq (rad/s): ω_n = sqrt(k / m)
Frequency (Hz): f_n = ω_n / (2π)

Damped System (c > 0)
Characteristic equation roots lead to damping ratio:
ζ = c / (2 * sqrt(km)) = c / (2 m ω_n)

Damped natural frequency (for underdamped case ζ < 1):
ω_d = ω_n * sqrt(1 - ζ^2)

Classification — Visual Summary
- Underdamped (0 < ζ < 1): decaying oscillations (most rotating machine cases).
- Critically damped (ζ = 1): fastest non-oscillatory return.
- Overdamped (ζ > 1): slow non-oscillatory return.

Example 1 — Undamped Natural Frequency
Given:
m = 5 kg, k = 2.0 × 10^4 N/m

Compute:
ω_n = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(20000 / 5) = sqrt(4000) ≈ 63.25 rad/s
f_n = ω_n / (2π) ≈ 10.07 Hz

Example 2 — Damped Natural Frequency
Using previous m and k, suppose c = 50 N·s/m.

Compute:
ζ = c / (2 * sqrt(k m)) = 50 / (2 * sqrt(20000 * 5)) = 50 / (2 * 316.23) ≈ 0.0791
ω_d = ω_n * sqrt(1 - ζ^2) ≈ 63.25 * sqrt(1 - 0.00626) ≈ 63.05 rad/s
f_d ≈ 10.03 Hz

Practical Sources of Damping in Machine Components
- Material (structural) hysteresis
- Interface friction (bearings, joints)
- Fluid damping (lubricants)
- Support and foundation damping
- Added dampers (viscoelastic mounts, tuned mass dampers)

Effects on Machine Components & Design Implications
- Resonance amplification increases fatigue risk in shafts/gears.
- Bearings: dynamic loads and whirling frequencies influenced by damping.
- Gearboxes: gear mesh excitation near ω_n can produce high vibration/noise.
- Rotors: critical speed matches natural frequency — avoid in operating speed range or add damping/stiffness.

Design strategies:
- Change stiffness (k) to shift ω_n.
- Alter mass (m) if feasible.
- Add or increase damping (raise ζ).
- Use isolation mounts to decouple excitation sources.

Measurement & Testing
Common methods:
- Impact (hammer) test to extract natural frequencies and damping (log decrement).
- Sweep/sine vibration testing to find resonance peaks.
- Operational modal analysis (OMA) using sensors during normal operation.

Key metrics:
- Frequency response function (FRF) — magnitude & phase vs frequency.
- Logarithmic decrement δ to compute ζ: ζ ≈ δ / (2π) for lightly damped systems.

Example: Log Decrement to Estimate ζ
From an underdamped free-response, measure successive peak amplitudes A1 and A2:
δ = ln(A1 / A2)
ζ ≈ δ / (2π)

Design Checklist to Avoid Harmful Resonance
- Identify operating speed range and harmonics.
- Calculate/measure natural frequencies (ω_n, ω_d).
- Ensure no critical natural frequency lies within the operating/excitation band.
- If unavoidable: add damping, alter stiffness/mass, or shift excitation frequency.
- Validate with testing (modal/operational).

Summary
- ω_n = sqrt(k/m) — fundamental undamped natural frequency.
- ζ = c / (2 m ω_n) — damping ratio determines response type.
- ω_d = ω_n sqrt(1 - ζ^2) — actual oscillation frequency when damped.
- Small ζ: ω_d ≈ ω_n but damping controls amplitude and resonance risk.
